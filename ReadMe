This is quickmon, a packet monitor for Econet networks.

There is no real documentation or support; you're essentially on your own.  But I will most likely listen to your problems and suggestions with some degree of tolerance.

The command-line options are:

-cooked		Display data in a more human-friendly form.
-raw		Don't try to interpret the packets; simply display the data
		as it comes.

-ascii		Display (printable) data as ASCII characters.
-hex		Display all data, printable or not, in hex.

-colour		Colourise the display. Different types of data and statuses
		are displayed in different colours.
-mono		Suppress colour.

-station ...	Only display traffic to or from one of the specified stations.

I have tested quickmon on RISC OS 3.1 only.  It has very little OS dependence, so chances are good it will work on RISC OS 2 or Arthur.  It has a lot of hardware dependence, so the odds are it will *not* work on a RiscPC.  It definitely won't work with Ethernet, Nexus or anything like that.
